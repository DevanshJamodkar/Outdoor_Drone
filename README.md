# Outdoor Drone â€“ Drone Swarm Simulation

This project is a **drone swarm simulation system** built using **ArduPilot (ArduCopter)** and the **Skybrush ecosystem**.  
It allows simulating outdoor drone light shows with multiple UAVs, synchronized flight patterns, and real-time visualization.

ðŸš§ **Note:** The project is still in development and may evolve over time.
